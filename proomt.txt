In the front-end portion of the app , I have these functionalities:- 
1. in the admin-dashboard admin can upload pdf , unique to a student ,
by filling information in a box which contains two fields, 
1. Roll_Number, which will map to a unique accountAddress, hence we can ge the 
accountAddress of the student using the findAccountAddressByRollNumber function
from UserManager.solidity
2. Document Name is input
3. The admin can upload the pdf file using some sort of button, after that the 
pdf is uploaded to ipfs and a hash is generated, which will be added to 
userToDocuments mapping using the ```function uploadDocument(
        string memory documentName,
        string memory ipfsHash,
        address userAddress
    ) external onlyRegisteredUser{} ``` from DocumentManager.sol
FYI I have install the kubo implementation of ipfs on my computer

What I know:-
"1. I know how to add file to ipfs using ```ipfs add <filepath>```
2. How to download file using ```ipfs get >file-hash```
